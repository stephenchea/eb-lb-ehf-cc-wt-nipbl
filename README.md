This repository contains the code that was used to analyze single cell RNA libraries of early bud, late bud, early head fold, and cardiac crescent stage wildtype and Nipbl+/- mouse embryos in "Gastrulation-stage gene expression in Nipbl+/- mouse embryos foreshadows the development of syndromic birth defects" by Stephenson Chea, Jesse Kreger, Martha E. Lopez-Burks, Adam L. MacLean, Arthur D. Lander, and Anne L. Calof. The code is organized by stage and tool used. Files are numbered according to the order in which they were run. Filenames summarize what was done in the code.
